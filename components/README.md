This sub-project implements the logical application (the interactor) and the components.

Perhaps each component would have its own sub-project, but this would create many small jars and  would get unmanageable.  To keep components isolated and interacting only through their definitions, only [Provider](url "../definitions/src/main/java/provider/Provider.java") classes are allowed to be public here.
