This sub-project implements the logical application (the interactor) and the components.

Perhaps each component should have its own sub-project, but this would create many small jars and would get unmanageable.  To keep components isolated and interacting only through their [definitions](../definitions), only classes implementing [Provider](../definitions/src/main/java/provider/Provider.java) are allowed to be public here.
